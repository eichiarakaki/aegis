components_socket: "/tmp/aegis-components.sock" # This is the socket where all components will register themselves to the communication engine. The communication engine will keep track of all registered components and their capabilities (e.g., which symbols and timeframes they support).
# Example of expected payload: 
# {
#   component_name: "data_engine", 
#   supported_symbols: ["BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT"], 
#   requires: ["klines", "orderbook"], 
#   supported_timeframes: ["1m", "15m", "30m", "4h", "1d"]
# }

aegis_cli_socket: "/tmp/aegis.sock" # This is the socket where the Aegis Daemon will listen for commands from the Aegis CLI. The CLI can send commands to start or stop sessions, check the status of components, or perform other administrative tasks. The Aegis Daemon will process these commands and respond accordingly.
